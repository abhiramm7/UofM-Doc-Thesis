\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.7}{\ignorespaces The stormwater \textit {feedback control loop}. A desired watershed outcome is compared, in real-time, to actual watershed state based on sensor measurements. The control logic then adjusts the states of valves, gates and pumps to drive the system toward the desired state. Disturbances, such as precipitation, may drive the system away from the desired outcome and must be controlled against when the feedback loop repeats.\relax }}{23}{figure.caption.7}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.1}{\ignorespaces Overview of the study area. The map (left) shows the location of relevant control and sensor sites, additional sensor sites (light grey), flow paths between each site (dark grey), and the contributing area of the watershed (light blue).

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.3}{\ignorespaces Characterization of control actions from site A. In the first two experiments, the valve at site A is opened for 1-hour and 4-hour durations. For the third experiment, the valve is held open indefinitely. The resulting waves travel through a constructed wetland (site C) before arriving at the outlet of the watershed. Wave depth (black line) is measured at the wetland, while flow rate (red line) is measured at the outlet.\relax }}{35}{figure.caption.10}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.4}{\ignorespaces Characterization of control actions originating from site B. Three subsequent pulses are released. While the duration of each control pulse is the same (1 hour), the magnitude of the flow at the outlet decreases because the hydraulic head (pressure) in the basin is reduced with each release. \relax }}{36}{figure.caption.11}

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.2}{\ignorespaces Stormwater system being controlled in this paper. The urban watershed includes a number of sub-catchments which drain to 11 stormwater basins {of varying storage volumes}. The first control scenario applies RL to the control of a single basin{s}, while the second scenario evaluates control of multiple basins. {The colors colors correspond with the catchment that contributes local runoff into each basin.} Average volumes experienced by the ponds during a 25 year 6 hour storm event are presented.\relax }}{55}{figure.caption.16}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.3}{\ignorespaces RL control of a single basin, trained using three reward formations (grouped by column). The first row plots each reward function used during training. The second row plots the average reward received during training ({please note that the scale of Y-axis differers for each reward function}). The third and fourth rows compare the controlled flows and water levels with the uncontrolled, for the episode that resulted in the highest reward. Generally, {more complex reward formulations} {reward function formulations with more explicit guidance} lead to relatively better control performance and improved convergence during raining. Agents trained using relatively simple reward also exhibit a rapidly-changing and unstable control behavior, shown as a close up in the bottom left plot.\relax }}{65}{figure.caption.17}

Control actions at each of the controlled basins are shown as valve settings in the fourth row of the plot. In this scenario, the agent achieves a high reward by just controlling the most upstream control asset (4) and shifting the peak of the hydrograph. Difference in the scale of Y-axis in second row demonstrates the wide range of inflows in the network.\relax }}{71}{figure.caption.19}
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {4.6}{\ignorespaces RL agent controlling multiple stormwater basins during a 24-hour, 10-year storm event. Control actions at each of the controlled basins are shown as valve settings in the fourth row of the plot. In this scenario, the agent achieves a high reward, by maximizing the storage utilization in the most upstream control asset (4) and regulating the outflow from it to meet the downstream objectives. Difference in the scale of Y-axis in second row demonstrates the wide range of inflows in the network.\relax }}{73}{figure.caption.20}

Given that the controller is trained to react based on the depth in the basins and not the rainfall experienced in the watershed, controller treats this back-to-back event as if it were a single event.\relax }}{90}{figure.caption.30}
